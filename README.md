# MetricsIntegratorAdapted
An adapted version of the [metricsIntegrator](https://github.com/keslleylima/MetricsIntegrator) at the test suite level.

A simple tool that uses as input the source code metrics file and the mapping between application methods and the test methods. As output, our application yields a file where each instance involves source code metrics of one test suite and the particular application method under test.

We developed this tool to generate the defined metrics to illustrate pontetial use of the dataset detailed in the paper "A dataset based on two graph coverage criteria: prime-path and edge coverage"
